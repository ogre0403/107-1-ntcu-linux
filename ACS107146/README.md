*** NO specific interest or hobby just want to master computer program and become skillful at writing them
< although my level or familiarity with computer may be fall far behind classmates i still somehow wanna try my potential on this >
*** though this is a report having us do our self introduction but there is really nothing special about me 
* so i decided to report my confusion on computer and relevant puzzles *
<___that is i am a student with no previous experience on computer so basically it would be impossible to get the points of professor immediately after each lecture nor is such student able to read the information on the internet themselves for the deficiency in rudimentary common sense of computer science. in sum, we can only follow after the demonstration of the professor instead of realizing the truly meaning and reason behind. i also know it is a waste of time to slow down and explain every action in details to such students. so can we come up with a more effective method to save such students. of course personal tutorial is a decent recomendation, but won't it be too late if we detect the incompetence of students after the mid-term test or even final test ? maybe we should take some proactive approach before students are facing fatal consequences resulted from unsolved confusion ?
